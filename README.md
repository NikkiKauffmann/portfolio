My website is a portfolio/gallery website. I have experimented with several javascript and css coding styles and have finally narrowed down which styles look best for my website
I have had a few bumps in the road in terms of tracking down errors in my coding, but I have found what I needed to fix and while it is not perfect, it was a fantastic learning experience.
